Hello all! My name is Joshua Ericson, I am ~~19~~ 20 years old, and I recently graduated Los Angeles Pierce College with an Associates degree in American Sign Language Interpretation. I am very passionate about quality of living and sustainability of cities and I will be studying City and Regional Planing at Cal Poly SLO for my Bachelor's Degree. My goal is to use the framework of Urbanism to pursue the betterment of citys' housing supply, walkability, and cycling and public transit infrastructure in order improve the daily lives of Americans in cities and to ease climate change.

For the past few years I have suspended my use of Social Media, and have been trying to slow down and keep in touch with people using messages and hanging out in person. But lately that time that I used to spend interacting with friends' posts on Instagram and Twitter has been replaced by constantly seeking out short-form video content on Tik Tok and Youtube Shorts. I have noticed a lot of the same unhealthy habits that originally made me stop using Social Media, have entered my life again. With the difference being, that now on Tik Tok, I do not have the confidence or desire express myself by posting, and so I have lost nearly all of my outlets to share my thoughts and opinions.

That is why I am now starting this blog, I wanted to find a non-social media place to be able to express myself and share my ideas about tech, media, travel, public transit, and any variety of other topic. And so while I could have done this on Twitter, Mastadon, or Tumblr, I really wanted to be able to take more ownership of my posts, so it seemed like going back to the genesis of the Internet and creating a Blog was my best choice.

So here it is: Joshua's Variety Blog

Thank you for joining me on this journey! ðŸ’•
