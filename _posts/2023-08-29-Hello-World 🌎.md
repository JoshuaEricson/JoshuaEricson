Hello all! My name is Joshua Ericson, I am ~~19~~ 20 years old, and in a few weeks, I will be attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to study City and Regional Planning. I have been wanting to set up a website for almost half a year now, and after a month long road trip and lots of hanging out with friends and family this summer, I was finally able to sit down with my dad and get it setup successfully!

I have been on and off social media for the past few years, deleting and redownloading the instagram, twitter, and youtube apps many times over. I have felt pressure to use apps like instagram and Be Real because that is often where my friends share what they are up to, and where their attention can be most easily accessed. I found myself reflexively opening the instagram app whenever my brain wasn't otherwise occupied, hoping that a close friends had posted to their story about the show they were watching or the museum they went to, but most of the time just closing the app within minutes or seconds of opening it, finding that nothing new had appeared on my feed.



So that is part of the reason why I wanted to start a blog

recently graduated Los Angeles Pierce College with an Associates degree in American Sign Language Interpretation. I am very passionate about quality of living and sustainability of cities and I will be studying City and Regional Planing at Cal Poly SLO for my Bachelor's Degree. My goal is to use the framework of Urbanism to pursue the betterment of citys' housing supply, walkability, and cycling and public transit infrastructure in order improve the daily lives of Americans in cities and to ease climate change.

And occasionally those online interactions would lead to progression in our friendship such as hanging out or bonding over an experience or piece of media. The problem was that

That is why I am now starting this blog, I wanted to find a non-social media place to be able to express myself and share my ideas about tech, media, travel, public transit, and any variety of other topic. And so while I could have done this on Twitter, Mastadon, or Tumblr, I really wanted to be able to take more ownership of my posts, so it seemed like going back to the genesis of the Internet and creating a Blog was my best choice.

So here it is: Joshua's Variety Blog

Thank you for joining me on this journey! ðŸ’•
